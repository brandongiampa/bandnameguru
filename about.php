            <h1>About the Guru</h1>
            <p>
                You practice hard. Your bandmates do as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, no matter how you practice or how talented you are, the first thing to generate interest in the eyes of potential fans is <a href="https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/music-promotion/basics-band-branding/" class="link">your branding as a band</a>.
            </p>
            <p>That starts first and foremost with your name. So why would you levae the naming process to an amateur? You have access to a <span class="orange">guru</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="orange">Guru of Rock</span> is your magic window into all things rock and roll.
            </p>
            <p>Hailing from the dark forests of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" class="link">Detroit, Michigan</a>, His Wiseness is responsible for the naming of millions of local acts. Only someone with such experience would be able to generate such classic monikers as <a href="https://www.googoodolls.com/" class="link">the Goo Goo Dolls</a> and <a href="https://smashingpumpkins.com/" class="link">The Smashing Pumpkins</a></p>
            <p>
                <small class="text-gray">NOTE: The Guru of Rock does not claim to have generated these names, though he can produce hundreds of similar quality throughout the course of a day.</small>
